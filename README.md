# Pothole Detection System

## Overview
This project delves into the realm of pothole detection utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We meticulously evaluate the efficacy of three distinct models: CNN with Fully Connected Layer Model, CNN with Global Average Pooling Model, and YOLO v4. The primary objective is to ascertain an efficient and precise method for identifying potholes in road images.

## Conclusion
Innovative methodologies for pothole detection were devised, leveraging three distinct models: CNN with Fully Connected Layer Model, CNN with Global Average Pooling Model, and YOLO v4. A substantial dataset comprising images of potholes captured under diverse conditions and weather scenarios was meticulously curated. Following rigorous training and augmentation techniques applied to the dataset, the accuracy of all three models was meticulously assessed, yielding the following results:
- CNN VGG16 with Fully Connected Layer Model: 94.07%
- CNN VGG16 with Global Average Pooling Model: 93%
- YOLO v4: 92%
A comparative analysis between the convolutional neural models and YOLO v4 was conducted, elucidating superior accuracy in identifying potholes through the employment of one of the pre-trained convolutional neural networks.
